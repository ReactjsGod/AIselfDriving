Self-Driving AI with Neural Network Machine Learning
Welcome to our Self-Driving AI project powered by state-of-the-art Neural Network Machine Learning, all implemented in JavaScript! ðŸš—ðŸ¤–

Project Overview
Our project is a groundbreaking endeavor to create a self-driving car AI that can navigate and make decisions in real-world scenarios. 
Using advanced Neural Network models implemented in JavaScript, 
You can trained the AI to recognize patterns, learn from data, 
and make intelligent decisions while driving.
please do try it out! you will love itðŸ¥°

Features
Neural Network Architecture: Our AI system is built on a sophisticated Neural Network architecture, 
written in JavaScript, enabling it to process complex information and make decisions based on real-time data.

Real-time Data Processing: The AI processes data from various sensors, 
such as cameras and lidar, 
in real-time to understand its environment and make driving decisions accordingly.

Machine Learning: Through continuous Machine Learning, 
our AI system learns from its experiences, improving its driving abilities over time. 
It can adapt to new situations and challenges, making it a truly intelligent self-driving solution.
